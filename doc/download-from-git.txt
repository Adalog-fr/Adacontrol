How to get AdaControl from SourceForge / Git
============================================

Prerequesites
-------------
- Any version of Gnat (but we recommend using the latest one), GPL or
  PRO,with ASIS installed. We strongly recommend to install ASIS in
  the GNAT repository.
- Git. At Adalog, we use the one that's distributed with Cygwin.
- Cygwin or Mingwin (not required, but recommended). Several useful
  scripts are bash scripts.

Installing AdaControl
---------------------
At Adalog, we believe in software components. True software
components,  i.e. pieces of code that are shared between several
programs - not copies with as many versions as using programs ;-).

For this reason, there are three repositories that contain the various
sources that are part of AdaControl:
   - AdaControl itself;
   - Adalog_Comps, general software components that are of interest
     for any program;
   - Adalog_Asiscomps, software components that are of in interest for
     any ASIS application.

To install AdaControl, you'll need to create three directories
(anywhere you please), that we'll call <Adactl_Dir>, <Comps_Dir>, and
<Asiscomps_Dir>, respectively.

1) Change to <Adactl_Dir> and issue the following commands:
git clone git://adacontrol.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/adacontrol/adacontrol ./
mkdir adalib

2) Change to <Comps_Dir>, and issue the following commands:
git clone git://adacontrol.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/adacontrol/adalog_comps ./
mkdir adalib

3) Change to <Asiscomps_Dir>, and issue the following commands:
git clone git://adacontrol.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/adacontrol/adalog_asiscomps ./
mkdir adalib

4) Make sure that <Comps_Dir> and <Asiscomps_Dir>  are on your
   GPR_PROJECT_PATH environment variable.

To compile AdaControl, change to <Adactl_Dir> and type:
gnatmake -P adactl

You can check that everything is OK by changing to <AdaCtl_Dir>/test and
issuing the following command:
run.sh

Once AdaControl is installed, you can update it to the latest version by performing
the following steps:

1) Change to <Adactl_Dir> and issue the following command:
git pull git://adacontrol.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/adacontrol/adacontrol

2) Change to <Comps_Dir>, and issue the following command:
git pull git://adacontrol.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/adacontrol/adalog_comps

3) Change to <Asiscomps_Dir>, and issue the following command:
git pull git://adacontrol.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/adacontrol/adalog_asiscomps


SourceForge vs. Source distribution of AdaControl
-------------------------------------------------
There are 2 ways of getting the sources of AdaControl: from Adalog's
regular source  distribution at http://www.adalog.fr/adacontrol2.htm,
or from SourceForge.

Only the latest, released, version of AdaControl is available from the
source distribution. It contains all sources - components as well as
AdaControl - in a single directory. It is primarily intended to allow
people who use a version of Gnat different from the latest GPL release
to build AdaControl with their version of Gnat.

The SourceForge version includes all previous versions, under version
control, as well as the latest improvements that are not yet
released. It is organized following Adalog's internal structure -
components are kept separate from the program. It is mainly intended
for those who want to participate in the development of AdaControl,
or who want the latest bleeding-edge version.


Versions of AdaControl vs. versions of the components
-----------------------------------------------------
Adalog_Comps is very stable, but Adalog_Asiscomps is improved quite
often. We are very careful about keeping upward compatibility of the
components, therefore you should be able to compile any version of
AdaControl with the latest version of the components. An exception to
this can happen when a new value has been added to an enumeration type
of the components, therefore making some case statements incomplete in
older versions of AdaControl.

If you want to recreate the exact version that corresponds to a public
release,  you'll need to checkout the version of the components that
was used at the time the release was issued. To facilitate this, these
versions are tagged with a name of the form
"AdaControl_<version>". For example, to get the version of the
components that was used for AdaControl 1.12r4, checkout
"AdaControl_1.12r4".

"Old" and "New" versions of AdaControl
--------------------------------------
The default branch ("master") corresponds to the latest version of
Gnat.  It will compile only with versions more recent than
GnatPRO-7.1.0 or GnatGPL-2012.  If you are using an older version of
Gnat, checkout the branch "master-old_gnat".
