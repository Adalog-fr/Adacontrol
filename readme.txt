AdaControl is an Ada rules controller. It is used to control that Ada
software meets the requirements of a number of parameterizable
rules. It is not intended to supplement checks made by the compiler,
but rather to search for particular violations of good-practice rules,
or to check that some rules are obeyed project-wide.

Please refer to the User's guide (adacontrol_ug.html,
adacontrol_ug.pdf or adacontrol_ug.info) in directory doc for
information about how to install and run AdaControl.

Commercial support is available for AdaControl; please refer to
doc/support.txt for details.
