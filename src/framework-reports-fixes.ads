package Framework.Reports.Fixes is

   -- This package provides the facilities for generating fixes.
   -- Since a fix corresponds to a message, these services must be called after the corresponding call to Report
   -- for Check or Search, but not after a call to Report for Count

   Line_Delimiter : constant Wide_String; -- This string causes a line break in inserted text

   function Indentation_Of (Original : Asis.Element) return Wide_String;
   -- Leading part of the line that contains Original, up to the first non-blank character
   -- Useful to insert a line with the same indentation as something else
   -- Returning the part of the string allows to preserve possibe control characters.

   procedure Refactor (Original : Asis.Element);
   -- Activates the "refactor" menu of GPS. To be used, f.e., when the name of an element is changed

   procedure Replace (Original : Asis.Element;
                      By       : Wide_String);

   procedure Delete (Elems : Asis.Element_List);
   procedure Delete (From  : Location; To : Location);
   -- From included, To excluded
   -- Note: To is excluded so that a deletion up to an element does not have to search the preceding element,
   --       which could be on a previous line.

   procedure List_Remove (Inx : Asis.List_Index; From : Asis.Element);
   -- From is expected to be an element accepting a list of names (like a with clause
   -- or a use clause);
   -- Inx is the index of the element to be removed from From
   -- The element is removed from From; if it is the only element in From, then From
   -- is deleted in whole.
   -- See List_Remove with an incremental fix below for the case of successive List_Remove from
   -- a same clause
   procedure List_Remove (Name : Asis.Name);
   -- Like above, but Name is searched in the Enclosing_Element to find its index
