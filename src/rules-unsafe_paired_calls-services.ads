private package Rules.Unsafe_Paired_Calls.Services is

   ------------------- Ignore statements that cannot raise exceptions at end of sequence
   function Effective_Last_Statement_Index (Stats : Asis.Statement_List) return Asis.ASIS_Natural;
   -- Returns the index of the last statement of Stats that is not an exit, return, or null statement
   -- Returns 0 if not found

   function Effective_Last_Statement (Stats : Asis.Statement_List) return Asis.Statement;
   -- Returns the last statement of Stats that is not an exit, return, or null statement
   -- Failure if not found

   ------------------ Signature of a lock call possibly nested
   type Nesting_Signature is new Asis.Element_List;
   -- Describes the nesting of if statements down to the initial call
   -- A list containing:
   --   For an if: the if_statement (can provide the condition_expression)
   --   For a path: the path
   --   For a call: the call
   -- The call is always the last element of the list

   Invalid_Nesting : exception;
   -- Raised by Signature if for some reason the structure does not obey the required model, including:
   -- An if statement is not the only statement of its path, except for terminating return, exit, null
   -- A condition_expression is not a simple boolean constant
   -- Another kind of statement is encountered
   -- The associated Exception_Message provides more information

   function Signature (Stmt : Asis.Statement; With_Check : Boolean) return Nesting_Signature;
   -- Computes the signature by going up enclosing elements from Stmt
   -- Stops when anything else than if's (and corresponding paths) is encountered,
   --    or when an if has a condition which is not a simple reference to a boolean constant
   -- If With_Check is True, raises Invalid_Nesting for an inappropriate construct, otherwise
   --    returns the signature up to (not including) the inappropriate construct

   function Matching_Call (Stat : Asis.Statement; Signature : Nesting_Signature) return Asis.Statement;
   -- Returns the call burried into Stat (nested if statements...)
   -- Checks that Stat contains only (nested) if statements with no elsif paths, that the structure matches Signature,
   --    (including that every condition expression of if statements matches the one from the signature).
   -- Does not check that the call is an opening / closing call matching the one from Signature
   -- Returns Nil_Element if the checks fail.

   function Matching_Block (Stat : Asis.Statement; Signature : Nesting_Signature) return Asis.Statement;
   -- Check that enclosing elements of Stat match the structure of Signature and return the top of the
   -- corresponding opening/closing block
   -- Return Nil_Element if enclosing elements of Stat do not match Signature.
   -- Precondition: Stat is a procedure (or entry) call (not checked)
