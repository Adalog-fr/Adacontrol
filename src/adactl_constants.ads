   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   -- These constants define limits about the rules themselves
   -- These limits are arbitrary and can be changed at will, no other change is needed.

   -- Maximum number of characters in a rule's name

   Max_Rules : constant := 100; -- Max number of rules in AdaControl
   type Rules_Count is range 0 .. Max_Rules;


   -- These constants define limits about what "reasonable" programs may contain.
   -- They can be used by rules to limit some capabilities.
   -- These limits are arbitrary and can be changed at will, no other change is needed.

   Max_ID_Length : constant := 250;
   -- Max length of an Ada identifier (and of a keyword by the same token)

   Max_Controls_For_Rule : constant := 100;
   -- For rules that need an upper bound to the number of times they can
   -- be specified in a control

   Max_Controls_Set : constant := 50;
   -- As previous, but for rules that need a set (array of boolean) of controls

   Max_Parameters : constant := 30;
   -- Maximum number of parameters declared by a subprogram or an entry

   Max_Loop_Nesting : constant := 20;
   -- Maximum depth of nested loops
