=============
== V1.5r24 ==
=============

General
-------
Do no stop analysis of rules file at first error

Option to just check syntax (-C)

Option to specify a trace file (-t, set trace)

Option to not print warnings (-E, set warnings on/off).

Option to report statistics (-S, set statistics)

Option to output result in various formats
 (-F, set format gnat/gnat_short/csv/csv_short/csvx/csvx_short/source/source_short)

Improved processing of child units: parent context is properly restored.

-v option displays progression indicator, tells units not found, does
   not print messages about controlling units that cannnot exist (SP
   bodies without specs, package specs that cannot have bodies) reports
   execution time.

Less tree swapping in Local_Hiding, should result in sensible speed improvement

Improved integration into GPS

Changes to existing rules
-------------------------
Allocators:
  Treat T'Class as T'Class, no more as T
  added task and protected

Declarations:
  added parameters:
        access_protected_type, access_task_type, array, array_type,
        child_unit, constant, constrained_array_type,
        decimal_fixed_type, defaulted_discriminant,
        defaulted_generic_parameter, defaulted_parameter,
        derived_type, discriminant, enumeration_type, entry,
        extension, fixed_type, float_type, formal_function,
        formal_in_out, formal_package, formal_procedure, generic,
        handlers, integer_type, modular_type, multiple_names,
        named_number, not_operator_renames, null_extension, operator,
        null_ordinary_record_type, null_tagged_type,
        ordinary_fixed_type, ordinary_record_type, package_statements,
        protected, protected_entry, protected_type, renames, separate,
        signed_type, single_array, single_protected, single_task,
        subtype, tagged_type, task_entry, task_type, type,
        unconstrained_array_type
  changed parameters:
         access => access_type, access_subprogram => accept_subprogram_type

Entities:
  Follows renamings and instantiations

Exception_Propagation:
  added a level of checking to specify the possibility of exceptions being raised
  during the elaboration of declarative parts
  added "declaration" keyword

Local_Instantiation:
  without parameter, all local instantiations are controlled

Naming_Convention:
  added any|local|global modifier

No_Closing_Name:
  no more a rule of its own, now a subrule of style

Parameter_Aliasing:
  new algorithm, handles more static cases where there is no true aliasing

Pragmas:
  allow "all" as parameter

Silent_Exceptions:
  Bug fix when complicated exit in loops
  handle function calls and generic instantiations.
  More clever analysis of for loops
  Can specify "return" and "requeue" as non-silent actions

Simplifiable_Expressions:
   All cases of unnecessary parentheses are now controlled.

Specification_Objects
   The rule is now part of Usage (object, from_spec)
   Better treatment of references to objects through formals in-out from within instantiations

Statement:
   Changed name to statements (with an "s", for consistency with other rules)
   Added parameters: Accept_Return, Asynchronous_Select,
         Case_Others_Null, Conditional_Entry_Call,  Entry_Return,
         Exception_Others, Exception_Others_Null, Exit_For_Loop,
         Exit_While_Loop,  Function_Return, Loop_Return,
         Multiple_Exits, No_Else, Procedure_Return, Raise_Standard,
         Selective_Accept, Timed_Entry_Call, Unconditional_Exit,
         Unnamed_Multiple_Loop,  Untyped_For, While_True

Unnecessary_Use:
  Bug fix
  works with use clauses coming from parent units

When_Others_Null
  no more a rule of its own, now a subrule of statements

Commands
--------
Inhibit:
   Added "all" for rule names, "all" for units

Framework:
----------
Added boolean trace procedure
Added support for "textual" rules
Evaluator for static expressions and static ranges
Support for float parameters, negative values for integer and float parameters
... and a few other utilities

=============
== V1.4r20 ==
=============

Bug fix and speed improvement in rule Local_Hiding.

=============
== V1.4r18 ==
=============

General:
--------
Interactive mode.

option "-f -" to read Standard_Input in non-interactive mode

New commands: go, clear, quit, set, output, help, inhibit
New rule type: count

Support for attributes, and syntax "all '<attr>"

Rule files no_standard_entity.aru, no_system_entity.aru and no_standard_unit.aru

Small improvements, bug fixes...

New rules:
----------
Declarations
Exception_Propagation
Naming_Convention
Real_Operators
Representation_Clauses
Side_Effect_Parameters
Simplifiable_Expressions
Specification_Objects
Statements
When_Others_Null

Changes to existing rules:
--------------------------
Non_Raising_Non_Reporting_Exception_Handler changed to Silent_Exceptions
Attributes removed (Attributes are now processed by Entities)

Support for litteral expressions in Parameter_Aliasing

Framework:
----------
Added procedure Command + Finalize to all rules.
Packages Framework.Plugs, Framework.Specific_Plugs
New naming scheme for tests
Improvements to the parameter parsing procedures
Changed the processing of strings ("...") in the scanner.

============
== V1.3r2 ==
